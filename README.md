**AIM OF PARITY GENERATOR:**

A parity generator generates a parity bit based on the number of 1's in a given 
data word. There are two types of parity:

**1. Even parity:** The parity bit is set to ensure the total number of 1's 
(including the parity bit) is even.

**2. Odd parity:** The parity bit is set to ensure the total number of 1's 
(including the parity bit) is odd.
